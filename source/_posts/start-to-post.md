# Start to blog

It has been a while that I hoped that I can write posts regularly.

# What is going to be blogged

There would be couple of purposes that I plan to blog.

Technical thoughts, I come up with ideas now and then, some of them are worthing thinking about further.

Learning notes, It is a good way to write down important points or outline in learning new tech. 

New findings, share new findings that might be helpful for me and others.
